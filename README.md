## Project Description

This project involves the creation of a responsive website featuring a photo gallery and a section showcasing highlighted places. The site's structure and design have been carefully developed following principles of accessibility, semantic HTML, and adaptive design to ensure an optimal user experience across all devices.

All design sections have been implemented, including `photo-grid` and `places`, using CSS Grid layout. The site visually aligns with the provided design and displays correctly in modern browsers like Google Chrome and Firefox.

Media queries have been applied to ensure the layout remains functional and visually consistent across various screen resolutions (1280px, 768px, and 320px), with no content overflow or horizontal scrollbars.

##  Technologies and Techniques Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure of content.
- **CSS3**: Visual styling and layout of the website.
  - Utilizes **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** for layout and alignment.
  - Responsive design through the use of **media queries**.
  - Styles organized using the **BEM methodology** (Block, Element, Modifier) with a flat file structure.
- **Fonts**: Uses the **Inter** typeface with system font fallbacks.

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML for markup and CSS for a clean, modern, responsive design.

- **Deployment**: Hosted via **GitHub Pages**.
