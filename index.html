It is believed to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Eight hundred years later, the self-proclaimed Pearl of Wales on the shores of Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.

Cricieth is also famous for winning the Wales in Bloom award five years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around the town. It was also the birthplace of David Lloyd George, the only Welshman to have served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

                            Berea is a small town located in central Kentucky. The town is surrounded by beautiful forests and fields. Known as the craft capital of the state, visitors will find endless shopping opportunities: jewelry stores, candle shops, and handcrafted woodwork; galleries, glass workshops, and more. The town holds an annual festival that pays tribute to "spoonbread," a local dish made from cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.

Berea College was founded in 1855 and was the first racially integrated southern university, as well as the first to be coeducational. Something that somewhat makes it unique is that it doesn't charge tuition: each student receives a 100% scholarship.
